## Overview
This task shows network scanning skills:
Scanning local network (192.168.138.0/24) for open ports using Nmap tool
Identifying services on open ports and their vulnerabilities

## Tools used:
-**Nmap** :- Network scanning and Vulnerability detection
-**Wireshark** :- For capturing packets of scanning
-**Github** :- For documentation

.Network range - 192.168.138.0/24

# Sync scan:
nmap -sS 192.168.138.0/24 -o sync_scan.txt

# Script scan and service version detection: 
## nmap -sS -sV -sC 192.168.138.128 -o 192.168.138.128.txt
## nmap -sS -sV -sC 192.168.138.130 -o 192.168.138.130.txt
## All script scan file are present in .txt files
